[Pregelix](http://hyracks.org/projects/pregelix/) is an open-source implementation of the bulk-synchronous vertex-oriented programming model ([Pregel API](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/06/large-scale-graph-computing-at-google.html)) for large-scale graph analytics, which scales to very large clusters and very large graphs.

This article aims to recode my study and development of Pregelix applications.
